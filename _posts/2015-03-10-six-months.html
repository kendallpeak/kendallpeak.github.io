<p>Alison hit six months just a few days ago, and as you can see she is healthy and happy. We are happy to report she weighed in at 17lbs which is in the 98th percentile, and taking after daddy, measured in at 27" long which according to the doctor is 'off the charts'. Her bottom two front teeth are just poking out, and while she hasn't got it down yet, should be crawling any day now. Her laugh is amazing and her smile lights up the room. We are the luckiest parents in the world, and these six months have been amazing.</p>
