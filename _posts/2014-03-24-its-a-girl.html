<p>Now that the shower is out of the way we can proudly announce that we are expecting a baby girl this August! Alison Noel Peak is busy growing, getting bigger and bigger, and apparently causing Kendall the worst heartburn in the history of mankind. So far all the doctor visits and ultrasounds indicate that she is perfectly healthy with a very strong heartbeat. During the gender scan she was moving around all over the place, and Kendall sure can feel her now but I haven't been as lucky. The books and information we have read are all saying we should be able to feel kicking and movement from the outside in the next few weeks, so I can't wait.</p>
