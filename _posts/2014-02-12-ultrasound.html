<p>So this is from a while ago, but being a proud new father how can I not share the first photo of my child!</p>
<img src="/images/baby.jpg" alt="Ultrasound" />
<p>This was taken on January 9th, and as you can see it looks just like me. Okay, not exactly. From what they say the head is on the right and there is a tiny little beating heart in the middle. I was speechless when I saw the flickering heartbeat on the monitor. Truly amazing.</p>
