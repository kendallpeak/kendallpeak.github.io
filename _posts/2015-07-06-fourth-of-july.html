<p>I was lucky enough to spend the weekend surrounded by family in both Chicago and Indiana. Many thanks to Al (Happy Birthday!) &amp; Barb for hosting us for <a href="/swimming">swimming and food on Saturday</a>, and the entire Wilcox family for <a href="/wilcox">inviting us down to Indiana on Sunday</a>. We are extremely lucky to have such a great family.</p>
