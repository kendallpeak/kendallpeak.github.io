<p>We had our gender reveal ultrasound today and got some beautiful pictures of our little one. It's a .... not so fast! We are going to make the big announcement on Saturday at our shower/bon-voyage party, so until then you'll just have to keep guessing if Baby Peak gets a blue or pink onesie! For our friends and family not local or who can't make the party we'll update the site as soon as it's over to share our joy!</p>
