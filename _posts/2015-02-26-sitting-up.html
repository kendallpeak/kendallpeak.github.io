<p>Alison is working on a new skill recently - she's now sitting up. While she doesn't get there on her own, she enjoys grabbing our hands and getting pulled up into position where she sits happily for a while before slowly rolling over to one side. She is now scooting backwards and really rolling all over, getting very close to crawling any day now.</p>
