<p>Alison hit 5 months last weekend and she is trying her hardest to move as much as she can. She is now rolling all over the apartment. Last night we were having playtime in the living room and she proceeded to roll across the room until she got to our hallway closet looking into the bedroom. What a stinker!</p>
