<p> While I don't exactly have any legit cravings per se, I have been making these sandwiches that I think will be good because I'm hungry, and trying to be budget-conscious. So far, I really like my little lunch/dinner creations, but I've only made 2 so far. I believe I would eat these even if I weren't pregnant, but Chris isn't so sure. I'll post the recipes here, and try them again post-pregnancy just to see. </p>

<h3>Under The Sea Delight</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Bread</li>
	<li>Seafood Salad</li>
	<li>Guacamole</li>
	<li>Black Olive Slices</li>
</ul> 

<p>First, slice your bread. I used sub bread. Smear the Guac on there like mayo. Then dump 1/4 lb of Seafood Salad. I like the Jewel deli kind. Lastly, sprinkle the seafood salad with black olive slices. Then eat. YUM!</p>

<h3>Mermaid Fart</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Onion Bagel</li>
	<li>Cream Cheese</li>
	<li>Sardines in Olive Oil</li>
</ul>
<p>Toast your bagel. Smear the cream cheese on the bagel, I like the Onion &amp; Chive kind. Then put your sardines on the sandwich. Put it together and eat!</p>
<p>I enjoy a gallon of orange juice with each sandwich. I hope you will too.</p>
