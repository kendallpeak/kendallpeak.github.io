<p>Alison's picked up a new trick - rolling over! When she lays down on her back she rocks to one side and almost instantly flips over, then pops her arm out and starts looking around. Before she was fussing a bit when she got over, but now it seems she is really trying to scoot around. I can't believe its been 3.5 months already!</p>
