<p>After many delays things are starting to speed up quite a bit. Passports and important documents are being submitted for our official visa applications, which means we could be wheels up to London in a month or so (give or take some time to get things packed and settled here). I feel like I am up to my neck in paperwork but its all worth it.</p>
